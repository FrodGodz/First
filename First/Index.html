        <p>Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air—pollutants which are detrimental to human
            health and the planet as a whole. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year air pollution
            is responsible for nearly seven million deaths around the globe. Nine out of ten human beings currently
            breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s guideline limits for pollutants, with those living in low- and
            middle-income countries suffering the most. In the United States, the Clean Air Act, established in 1970,
            authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard public health by regulating the
            emissions of these harmful air pollutants.</p>

        <p>
            “Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air
            Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and
            chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes
            to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane
            raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution, smog, is then worsened by that
            increased heat, forming when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change
            also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants, including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused
            by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season).

            “We’ve made progress over the last 50 years improving air quality in the United States thanks to the Clean
            Air Act,” says Kim Knowlton, senior scientist and deputy director of the NRDC Science Center. “But climate
            change will make it harder in the future to meet pollution standards, which are designed to protect health.”

        <p>These are the two most prevalent types of air pollution. Smog (sometimes referred to as ground-level ozone)
            occurs when emissions from combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. Soot (also known as particulate
            matter) is made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or allergens—in the form of either gas
            or solids—that are carried in the air. The sources of smog and soot are similar. “Both come from cars and
            trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators, engines, generally anything that combusts fossil fuels such
            as coal, gas, or natural gas,” Walke says.</p>
